Description: This algorithm provides a numerical solution to the
        problem of maximizing a function. This is more efficient than
        the Gauss-Newton-like algorithm when starting from points very
        far from the final maximum. A new convergence test is
        implemented (RDM) in addition to the usual stopping criterion :
        stopping rule is when the gradients are small enough in the
        parameters metric (GH-1G).
