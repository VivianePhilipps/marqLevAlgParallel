Description: This algorithm provides a numerical solution to the
        problem of minimizing (or maximizing) a function. It is particularly suited for complex problems and more efficient than
        the Gauss-Newton-like algorithm when starting from points very
        far from the final minimum (or maximum). Each iteration is parallelized and convergence relies on a stringent stopping criterion based on the first and second derivatives. See Philipps et al, 2020 (arXiv:2009.03840).
